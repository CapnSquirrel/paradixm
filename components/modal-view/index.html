        <p>Modal view pop ups are incredibly intuitive to new users if used correctly.  Modal view pop ups are most typically used as a reaction to something the user is currently doing, has just done, or probably wants to do.  If used correctly and labeled properly, new users should not be confused by the purpose of a modal view pop up because of this.  The second place where learnability issues could arise is during the user interaction with the pop up.  Again, if used properly, a modal view pop up should contain only a few basic buttons or, if necessary, a very short form.  If the user will not be able to continue what they are doing until the pop up has been addressed, it should be required for the pop up to be addresses before it can be collapsed.  If the pop up is providing an essential piece of information or a form, and the user can continue doing what they are doing without addressing the pop up, it should be very easy to collapse the form.  These two guidelines are aimed to ensure new users are not led into a confusing application state.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="efficiency" role="tabpanel">
        <p>If used properly, modal view pop ups should almost be unnoticeable to frequent users.  There should only be a few buttons and forms should be very short.  The most commonly used button should be highlighted so a user can simply hit the ‘Enter’ key to trigger it or so it can easily be identified.  The pop up should also consistently appear at the same time during the use of an application, so frequent users become accustomed to the timing of when the pop up will appear.  The pop up should also consistently appear in the same location, so it can easily be identified by frequent users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="errors" role="tabpanel">
        <p>All buttons, forms, labels, and icons should follow the same guidelines as those the application triggering the modal view pop up uses.  Modal view pop ups should also not be cluttered with a lot of intractable objects to ensure the user’s mental model is correct.  Since modal view pop ups collapse after they are addressed, it is more difficult to undo an action.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="memorability" role="tabpanel">
        <p>If the guidelines for learnability and efficiency are met, modal view pop ups should not have memorability issues.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tab-pane" id="satisfaction" role="tabpanel">
        <p>Satisfaction is a very difficult usability metric to measure, but for a modal view pop up to be satisfying to interact with, it should be able to be quickly addressed and should be easily identifiable.  It should also give meaningful feedback to the user, with nice opening and closing animations as modal view pop ups are inherently objects that a user must look at and interact with.</p>

    <h4>Events</h4>

    <blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
      highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

    <p>The most relevant button event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the user has
      triggered the button. Secondary events include <code>hover</code>, indicating that a pointing device is explicitly
      within the button’s bounds.</p>

    <h4>State Diagram</h4>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

      <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

      <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
        usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
        however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
      viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
      it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
      state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

    <p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
      implementations, but in general they are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
        change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
        additional activity is performed.</li>

      <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
        the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
        from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Component in Action</h4>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Embedded or linked video (by you or by others [and if by others give credit]) showing the component in action.</p>

      <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="text-center">
      <button class="btn btn-default">Standard Bootstrap Button</button>
      <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="variance" role="tabpanel">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">

    <h3>Variants</h3>

    <blockquote>There is almost never just one form of a user interface component. Use this section to address variations
      on this theme. Some variations are sufficiently different that they are considered to be a different component
      entirely, despite very similar behavior. Meanwhile some variations are due to appearance only.</blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Menu items</em> are very close to buttons in behavior—they perform individual action elements upon simple
        invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
        different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

      <li><em>Links</em> can be considered as a specialized button—they are invoked almost identically, and their action
        is even more narrowly defined as moving the user to a different view or display. The distinction here is
        definitely less sharp than the distinction between a menu item and a button. For links within a document, the
        document might be viewed as a menu in itself, and thus links are “menu items” indicating what the user can view
        next. Thus, in some ways, links are hybrids between buttons and menu items.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

    <h4>Feedback</h4>

    <p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
      never doubt whether:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
      <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
        the action that triggers the button</li>
    </ol>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="platform-specifics" role="tabpanel">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">

    <h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
        the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
        buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
        for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

      <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
        on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
        more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
        explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

      <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
        may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
        folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

      <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
        interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
        user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
        might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
        platform-specific user interface component.</p>
