<p class="lead">A critical feature of GUI-based operating systems is the ability to change the dimensions of elements.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

    <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
      <blockquote>The arrow mouse cursor and resize buttons are the most common tools for element resize across multiple platforms.</blockquote>
      <p>Additionally, the most common element that a user resizes is the application window, thus typical appearance of resize components will reference those used for window resize. The resize of different elements require different interaction styles and are explored in the "variants" section.</p>
      <h4>Arrow Mouse Cursor</h4>
        <p>The dimensions of a window can be resized by manually changing the dimensions of the window. Manual resize mode is visually represented by a change in the mouse cursor icon's apprearance from a pointer to an arrow. The orientation of the arrow, indicates the direction of resize, whether horizontal, veritical or diagonal. Examples of arrow icons are shown below.</p>

      <h4>Resize Buttons</h4>
        <p>Windows can be resized automatically to fit the size of the screen. Buttons, typically located at the top of the window, accomplish this functionality</p>
        <em>INSERT IMAGE OF BUTTONS</em>

    <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
      <p>Windows are manually resized by clicking a point on along the parameter of the window, and dragging the mouse accordingly to get the window to the desired shape. Windows may alternatively be automatically resized through resize buttons on the window menu, which typically minimize or maximize the window.</p>

    <h4>Events</h4>
      <p>Standby - Hover (Reveal transformation options) - Click - (for direct) Choose Output State - Release Click - Resized - Standby</p>
      <p>The most relevent resize event is the <code>resize</code> event. A <code>resize</code> event is triggered when the size of the window has been changed. While maximizing or minimizing a window, a <code>minimize</code> or <code>maximize</code> event may also be triggered.</p>

    <h4>State Diagram</h4>
      <img src="resize_chart (1).png" alt="Resize Chart" height="450" width="300">
      <p>A window is typically in a <code>standby</code> phase before being resized. Once the mouse starts dragging the edge or corner, the window enters the <code>resizing</code> state. Once finished, the window reaches the <code>resized</code> state.</p>

    <h4>Component in Action</h4>

    <h3>Variants</h3>
      <blockquote>The interface behaviors of resize can vary, depending on the element that is being resized</blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Icon Resize</em>
          Resizing an icon can be accomplished by...
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <em>Text Resize</em>
          Resize text...
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Image Resize</em>
          Resize images...
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Split Screen</em>
          A function of the resize buttons is to allow for a full screen tiling of two windows to maximize the screen space use. In split screen mode, users can manually resize the windows by shifting the separation bar between the two windows. An in depth discussion of this interaction style is found here.

    <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
      <p>Resize is a critical and commonly used aspect of any GUI-based operating system. When evaluating this interaction component against Ben Shneiderman's five usability metrics outlined in his book <em>Designing the User Interace</em>, the most important metrics for resize are learnability, efficiency, errors, while less important are: memorability and satisfaction. Since it is a critical aspect of any GUI based operating system, most of the priority metrics are vital in this component's design analysis. Users who intend to resize a window must have no confusion as to how to accomplish the task. In the physical world, the natural way of unfolding or unrolling a piece of paper is to pull from either the sides or the corners. Resizing follows this natural way of thinking by allowing the user to increase or decrease the size from the corners and sides of the window, making the process simple to learn. Also, since resizing follows the natural mental model, the way in which the user resizes windows is easily memorable.</p>

      <p>Since window resizing corresponds to either mouse input or window menu input, the response is immediate. Since window resizing is easily learnable and highly memorable, it is unlikely that users commit errors when attempting the task.</p>
    
      <p>Due to its simplicity and utilitarian nature, resizing does very little in the way of providing satisfaction to the user. However, this does not detract from the overall good design of window resizing.</p>

    <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
      <p>Key characteristics of resizing include the changing of the mouse icon from a pointer to arrows along with the visible change in window size.</p>

    <h4>Feedback</h4>
      <p>For resizing, the window visibly grows larger or shrinks according to user input. In older operating systems, a rectangle is shown to represent the size the window will change to when the user stops dragging the mouse.</p>

    <h3>Platform Specific Instances</h3>
      <p>When resizing windows with a mouse in older operating systems, a rectangle would be drawn to indicate the resulting shape of the resize once finished dragging, as shown in the picture below. The computer is running on Windows 8.1, but is set to the style of older operating systems, such as Windows 98.</p>

      <br>
      <p>For modern operating systems, the window dynamically changes size and content within conforms to the shape as the window is resized, as demonstrated in the components in action video.</p>
