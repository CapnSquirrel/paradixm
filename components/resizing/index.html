<p class="lead">A critical feature of GUI-based operating systems is the ability to resize elements.</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
    <p><b>A resize event is characterized by a change in an element's dimensions.</b></p>
    <p>In contrast with zoom, which is a related feature, resize changes the dimensional properties (length and width) of the element itself, rather than the scope at which the element is displayed on a screen. Examples of commonly resized elements include windows, icons, images, and text. However, for the purposes of evaluating typical appearances and behavior, we will consider the resize behavior of windows.</p>
    <p>The arrow mouse cursor and resize buttons are the most common interface elements for changing the dimensions of elements.</p>

    <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
    <p>There are two categories of window resize behavior: manual and automatic.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6">
        <div class="panel panel-default">
          <div class="panel-heading">
            <h4 class="panel-title text-center">Manual</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>The dimensions of a window can be manually resized by a drag and drop operation using the arrow resize cursor. Entering manual resize mode is visually represented by a change in the mouse cursor icon's apprearance from a pointer to an arrow. The orientation of the arrow, indicates the direction of resize, whether horizontal, veritical or diagonal.Once in the resize stage, the perimeter of the window can be manipulated.</p>
            <h5>Events</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><code><b>hover</b></code></li>
              <p>The mouse event of <code>hover</code>ing over the perimeter of a window changes the cursor to an arrow which indicates the allowed direction of resize. When the cursor is an arrow, the user is in the <code>resize</code> state.<p>
              <li><code><b>mouse down</b></code></li>
              <p>A mouse down event, once in the <code>resize</code> state, begins  manual resize. While in <code>mouse down</code>, changes in the position of the mouse will manipulate the dimension of the window. The dimension change is visually rendered in real time.</p>
              <li><code><b>mouse release</b></code></li>
              <p>Upon arriving at the desired dimension in <code>mouse down</code>, <code>mouse release</code> will set the window dimension and exit the <code>resize</code> state.</p>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h4 class="panel-title text-center">Automatic</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Automatic resize, is independent of a user-defined end dimension. Resize to full screen causes the window to fill the entire screen. Typically this is trigged by clicking a button, which toggles from full screen to non-full screen.</p>
            <h5>Events</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><code><b>hover</b></code></li>
              <p><code>Hover</code>ing over a window button menu reveals symbols that indicate the different options for automatic resize<p>
              <li><code><b>click</b></code></li>
              <p>On <code>click</code> the window is resized to fit the entire window.

      <p>The following gifs represent only the resize functions within the Mac OSX platform that are common across different platforms (with minor stylistic differences). A closer look of resize in the OSX platform is explored in the "Platform-Specific Instances" section below.

            <h3>Manual Resize</h3>
            <p>This is an example of manually resizing a window. Upon hovering over the perimeter of the window, the mouse cursor changes into a resize cursor, which indicates the direction of resize possible. Manual resize is permitted within the boundaries set by the platform, which default to the screen size. Overrides to the default max size on the macOSX platform are that the window can only be resized up to the menu bar at the top and up to the dock at the left.</p>

              <h3>Automatic Resize</h3>
              <p>This is an example of automatically resizing a window. Hovering over the menu buttons to the left of the window reveals symbols that define the resize options possible. When in default (non-fullscreen mode), upon clicking the green button, the window will resize to fill the dimensions of the screen. When in fullscreen mode, upon clicking the same button, the window will resize to its size prior to being in fullscreen.</p>

    <h3>Variants</h3>
    <p>The interface behaviors of resize can vary, depending on the element that is being resized</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Slider</em>
        Resize can be accomplished by a slider.
      </li><br>
      <li><em>No resize</em>
        Resize can be accomplished by a slider.
      </li><br>
      <li><em>Form Fill-In</em>
        Most commonly for resizing text to a certain font point.
      </li><br>
      <li><em>Resize Text</em>
        Resize text...
      </li>
      <li><em>Split Screen</em>
        A function of the resize buttons is to allow for a full screen tiling of two windows to maximize the screen space use. In split screen mode, users can manually resize the windows by shifting the separation bar between the two windows. An in depth discussion of this interaction style is found here.

    <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
    <p>Ben Shneiderman, in his book <em>Designing the User Interace</em> defines learnability, efficiency, errors, memorability, and satisfaction, as metrics by which the usability of a system can be measured. Resize is a common interface component, and in a perfect system, all five metrics are important. Nevertheless, if the resize function as a user interface component is evaluated against these metrics, learnability and efficiency rise as the most important, whereas memorability, errors, and satisfaction are less important.</p>

    <div>
      <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
        <li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="Learnability" aria-controls="Learnability" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Learnability <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>

    <p>Resize is a critical and commonly used aspect of any GUI-based operating system. When evaluating this interaction component against Ben Shneiderman's five usability metrics outlined in his book <em>Designing the User Interace</em>, the most important metrics for resize are learnability, efficiency, errors, while less important are: memorability and satisfaction. Since it is a critical aspect of any GUI based operating system, most of the priority metrics are vital in this component's design analysis. Users who intend to resize a window must have no confusion as to how to accomplish the task. In the physical world, the natural way of unfolding or unrolling a piece of paper is to pull from either the sides or the corners. Resizing follows this natural way of thinking by allowing the user to increase or decrease the size from the corners and sides of the window, making the process simple to learn. Also, since resizing follows the natural mental model, the way in which the user resizes windows is easily memorable.</p>

    <p>Since window resizing corresponds to either mouse input or window menu input, the response is immediate. Since window resizing is easily learnable and highly memorable, it is unlikely that users commit errors when attempting the task.</p>
      

    <p>Due to its simplicity and utilitarian nature, resizing does very little in the way of providing satisfaction to the user. However, this does not detract from the overall good design of window resizing.</p>

      <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
      <h4>Direct Manipulation Interaction Style</h4>
      <p>Direct manipulation is an interaction style in which the changes that a user makes to an object are incrementable, reversible, and immediately represented on the screen. Manual resize is a classic example of direct manipulation. When a user resizes an element's dimensions manually, the impact of the change is visible immediately and continually on the user's screen. Thus, key characteristics of effective manual resize will be discussed in the context its classification as a direct manipulation implementation. Well implemented direct manipulation allows the user to achieve mastery of the interface, competence in performing tasks, and enjoyment in using the interface. The following principles and guidelines are relevant for informing best practices for resize interfaces.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Principle of Feedback</li>
        <p>Feedback is a defining interaction design principle of effective direct manipulation. Feedback in manual resize is characterized by a change in element's size on the screen in real time, as the user is resizing. Feedback time must be sufficiently fast, as any latency in the response will cause a delay in the user action - visual response feedback loop. 
        <li>Principle of Transparency</li>
        <p>In effective direct manipulation, the interaction tool itself becomes transparent to the user. As a direct manipulation interface, resize "tools" disappear as the user interaction with the element being resized through the mouse cursor is understood as an extension of a user's tactile functions, emphasizing the "direct"-ness of direct manipulation.</p>
        <li>Mental Model</li>
        <p>Overall, effective interaction design must allow for the user's mental model derived from the system image to correspond with the designer's mental model. Assisting this process in manual resize is the parallels that digital direct manipulation has with how users interact with the physical world. Physically resizing a moldable substance, such as clay or elastic is mirrored in the "grasping" <code>mouse down</code> and "stretching" <code>resize state</code> of a window or element on a screen.
