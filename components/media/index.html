              <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
              <p> Simple three button interface towards the bottom of the screen, previous file, Play/Pause, and next file. Top of the screen includes the file name, and any other details about the file if available. The middle of the screen will show the video itself or the album art in case of audio files. Other buttons include volume control through buttons or a slider, options to shuffle your list of songs or repeat a single song or playlist, and a drop down menu for media settings. In the case of a video, choices for the quality of the video are usually present when streaming it online. Lastly slider that corresponds to the video or song length and how far into the file you are is present at the bottom of the screen. </p>

               <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

               <p> Songs are listed by alphabetical order, and depending on what tab you are in you can search for specific artists or albums as well. When play button is clicked/pressed, the file will begin playing. Default speakers in the device will be used unless there are user designated speakers available (e.x. headphones plugged in, blue tooth stereo system set up, etc.). If the previous file button is pressed once, the player will return to the beginning of the current file. If it is pressed twice in rapid succession it will start playing the file that came before the current one. The next file button only needs to be pressed once to skip the rest of the current file and start playing the next file in the list. </p>

                 <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
                 <p>
                   For most users, media players are used to do one thing, to play the media that the user wants them to play. That being said, because it is more of a utilitarian component, there are some usability metrics that are not as importnat as others. Some of the important ones are learnability, efficiency, errors, and memorability.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <b>Learnability:</b> Media players have to be quickly learnable. For most users, the  media player is only a gateway for them to see the actual content. The quicker it is to learn the software the better. Many media players should come intuitively. The different buttons and icons are very similar to other physical media players such as DVDs, Blu-Ray players and CD players. This similarity helps for users to quickly learn how to watch media on their devices.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <b> Efficiency: </b> Since it is not so much the media player that is important then the actual content being played, media players must also be very efficient. Many of the players today have many keyboard shortcuts. Arrows can be used to skip songs or to fastforward or rewind per frame. Spacebar is also commonly used to play and pause. Also there are many shortcuts for fullscreen or to adjust the volume.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   <b> Errors: </b> Though errors are not fatal for media players, errors can annoy the user and take away from the content being shown. Errors such as play and pausing when the user wants to or wrong volume controls may not allow the user to play the video as intended. Since as said before, a media player is a gateway for the actual audio or video media. Therefore though the user may not be fatal, as long as the media does not get deleted, the errors for Media players should be very small.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     <b> Memorability:</b> Media players should be very memorable. When a media player isn't used for a long time, the user should automatically be able to remember how it functions because for the user, their intent is to watch the audio/video content that the media player is going to play. The mental model of the media player as well as the user should not be very different. To help to make sure it is memorable, similar icons are used throughout media players for common tasks such as play, stop, or skip.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                     <b>Satisfaction:</b> Satisfaction is not a very important component for media players. As long as the media player is able to play the content that the user wants then it is doing its job. It is the job of the content itself to satisfy the users.
                   </P>
                   <h3> Key Chararacteristics <small> what do all principles do all great media players have? </small> </h3>

                     <ol>
                         <li> <b>Feedback:</b> It is very important for the user to always get feed back for whatever action that they do. For example of the user presses play, the content should play. Also if the player pauses the video using the pause button, after clicking the content should also pause. If the content is still loading, a loading splash screen should also show up. This way the user will always know what state the media player is in. </li>

                         <li><b>Universality and Consistency:</b> Media and audio content should be accesible to everyone no matter where they are from. Universal signs for play, pause, skip and even volume are all very same and also derive from the physical machine buttons on DVD, Blu-ray, and CD players. Also many great media players will also have accsesiblity options such as closed captioning.</li>

                         <li> <b>Shortcuts:</b> For easy access and for easy use, media players should also have shortcuts for the most basic of functions such as pausing and skipping. </li>

                         <li><b> Transparency: </b> When users use the media player, it is not the media player that they are intersted in, instead it is the content. Many great media players have hover and hover off states where when the user is no longer hovering or doing any action to the buttons the control panel for the media player disapeers.</li>

          <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-12">

                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p> Hovering your mouse over the video or tapping the screen while the video is on will bring up the user interface. Clicking/pressing the Play/Pause button will trigger the file to start playing or pause at that time. If the previous file button is pressed once, the player will return to the beginning of the current file. If it is pressed twice in rapid succession it will start playing the file that came before the current one. The next file button only needs to be pressed once to skip the rest of the current file and start playing the next file in the list. Moving the slider for volume will increase or decrease the volume that the file is playing at.
                </p>

                <h4>State Diagram</h4>
                <p> In some media players there are two major states, when the <b>control shown</b> and <b>control hidden</b> states. In the control shown state this is when the user is able to control the video. Within this state there are multiple states: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Idle/Paused: When the media is stopped </li>
                    <li>Playback: When the media is playing </li>
                    <li>(Optional) Rewinding: When the media is playing backwards </li>
                    <li>(Optional) Fast Forwarding: When the media is playing ahead </li>
                </ul>

                <p> For video media players there are also options to change states between having the video play full screen and the video playing at the specifed size.</p>

                        <p>For Yosemite, after double-clicking on the icon, Quicktime Media player launches in a borderless window. The difference here is that there is no setting for quality. Instead it is all the same quality across the board. </p>

                        <h4> Key Characteristics </h4>
                        <p> In reference to the OSX Human Interface Guideline, Apple also references that Feedback and Assistance is important. Also keyboard alternatives are also very important. They encourage to "provide keyboard-only alternatives". Other important principles that are important are:  </p>

                        <ul>
                          <li> Direct Manipulations: An onscreen object must remain visible while performing actions on to it. Thus even though the controls may disappear on the media player, the content itself does not disapeer. </li>
                          <li> Feedback and Communication: There should be some reaction to every action that the user does towards the media player. </li>
                          <li> Consistency: Consistent to other versions of software and consistent to user mental models for other media players.</li>

                      <ul>
                          <li> For the iPhone instead of clicking, the user must tap in order to use the buttons. Also instead of hovering, the user must tap on the video in order for the controls to become hidden.</li>

                          <li> Pinching gestures allow you to zoom in and out of video.</li>
                          <li> Depending on the user's settings, rotating the device allows the video to also rotate from a smaller view to a larger view. </li>

                  <h3> Youtube </h3>
                  <p>Youtube's video player shows the play, next video, volume, close caption, settings, theather mode, and full screen button. When you hover over each icon it tells the user what each one stands for. So the play button plays and pauses the video, the next video button when hovered over shows the thumbnail of the next video and the title of the next video, the volume button opens the volume bar and can change the volume. The closed captions turns on the subtitles for the current video playing.</p>
                  <p>The setting button opens a menu that has a few option; autoplay, annotations, speed, subtitles/CC, and quality.  If the autoplay has the red check it will keep playing the next video that youtube’s algorithm picks and think you will like because the user is watching the current video. If annotations are on then the user can see what the video creator is linking or if they have anything linked on the side. The speed is how fast the video is playing, they have speeds going from .25 to 2 incrementing by .25 each time. The subtitles button lets you change the language of the subtitles.
                  The theater mode button changes the player to be wider and buts black bars on the side of the player. Finally the fullscreen button makes the player fit the screen.</p>

                  <p>The Ustream video player changes depending on what you are doing. If you are browsing other videos to stream then the video player becomes small and only has 3 options, the volume, play button, and full screen. The volume button opens up and the user can change the volume. The play button pauses and plays the video, and the fullscreen button makes the video player fullscreen.
                    If you are on a person’s streaming channel and watch it from there then the video player has many more options. It has the play button, volume, the progress bar, share, theater, new window, and fullscreen button.
                    The play button, pauses and plays the video. The volume button opens up when you hover over it and can change the volume. The progress bar lets the user move back and forward in the video.
                    When a person clicks the share button it opens up and gives 4 options facebook, twitter, copy link, embed. If you click facebook it takes you to your profile and pastes the link into the text box to post the message on your account. Same thing with twitter. Copy link, copys the video into your clipboard. The embed makes a pop up on the video and allows you to copy the code to embed this video if you are going to use it.
                    Theater button makes it into theater mode putting black bars on the side and makes the video player a little bigger than normal size. Then the new window button opens a new window with only the video playing in the window, and the last button being the fullscreen button doing the same thing as all the others.

                  <h3> Vimeo </h3>
                  <p>Vimeo, like youtube, is a site primarily used to display user created content. Vimeo’s video player reflects the sites decision to focus user content by providing unique features.</p>
                  <p>On the right hand side of the player, depending on the content viewed, users have access to a few buttons. From top to bottom they are labelled: Like, Add to Watch Later, Add to Collections, and Share. Depending on the content, like if a user was watching a trailer for a show, a button may be replaced for an option to buy a season of a show.</p>
                  <p>The Like button has the icon of a heart. The Add to Watch Later button has the icon of a clock. The Add to Collections button has the icon of stacked papers. The Share button has the icon of a paper airplane. </p>
                  <p>On large difference between Youtube’s video player and Vimeo’s is that even though Youtube allows for most of the above features, those buttons wouldn’t be located on the video player itself, but rather on the description of the video below the player.</p>
                  <p>The player also has the standard Play/ Pause button icon on the bottom left of the screen. The rest of the player’s features are located to the right of the Play/ Pause button on a toolbar of sorts. The Play/ Pause button switches between a right facing arrow and two parallel bars going up and down depending on if the video is paused or not.</p>
                  <p>Most of the tool bar is set up to show the duration of the video and at what point the user is on at the video. The Progress Bar of the video is set up in three colors. Blue represents what part of the video has been watched already. Grey represents the amount of video already loaded. Dark grey represents the amount of video yet to be loaded or watched. The is a small icon that appears when a user hovers over the video that shows the time on the video at which the user is stopped. The icon moves along the Progress Bar indicating where the user is at. If the user hovers over a spot on the Progress Bar, the video displays an image to the user of what is happening at that time in the video. </p>
                  <p>To the right of the Progress Bar is a set of five small bars, increasing in size from left to right, acting as the volume button. Clicking on the largest bar will increase the volume of the video to max, while the smallest will virtually mute the video. Users can also drag from right to left along the five bars to achieve their desired volume levels. The color on the bars changes from grey to blue to indicate volume. All grey meaning no volume, all blue meaning max volume.</p>
                  <p>The second to last button on the toolbar is an HD button. Once the HD button is clicked an option for what resolution change appears. The various selections range from auto, allowing the player to make the decision for the user, to the max resolution the video was designed to handle.
                  <p>The last button on the toolbar is a Fullscreen button. The icon for the full screen button is four arrows at each corner of the icon facing diagonally outwards. The arrows face inwards once the player is in fullscreen mode.
                  <p>One more thing to note is that each of the icons are highlighted blue as they are passed over. The icons at the top right also inform the user of their function. The volume icon is special though, it isn’t highlighted blue, rather whichever bar of the five bars the cursor is located on, increases in size so as not to confuse the user of what the volume level is currently at. </p>

                  <h3> Twitch </h3>
                  <p>Twitch is a live streaming site meant primarily for allowing streamers to stream gameplay content. There are two players to consider when viewing Twitch’s webplayer. The first is their standard video player and the second is available when the user wishes to browse for other content. </p>
                  <p>Note, when the icons are moused over they are highlighted in a soft purple hue. When the user hovers over the different buttons, users also get to see what the button does (i.e. if the user hovers over the play button, the words “play” appear over the button).</p>
                  <p>If a user clicks onto a stream and then clicks onto the browse button, the video will shrink onto a small player displayed at the bottom left of the website allowing users to browse for a new stream while staying entertained with another stream. The window of the player tells the user whose channel the user is watching and gives the user an option to close the window. There are only two buttons available on the small player. One is the standard Play/ Pause button and the other button restores the stream to the users main stream. The icon looks like a small window turning into a fullscreen window.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the information is regarding the video player when the video stream is live and when the video play is currently the user’s main stream. To indicate that the video streaming is live, the video player displays “a red circle” and the word “LIVE” at the top right of the screen.</p>
                  <p>The video has a Play/ Pause that alternates icons when the player is either playing or paused. This button, like most, is located at the bottom left of the screen. When the stream is paused, a Play icon appears in the middle of the screen, giving the user to options at which to start playing the stream again.</p>
                  <p>Beside the Play/ Pause button, on the right, is a control for the volume. The volume is controlled by a Speaker icon. The Speaker icon can be clicked to mute and unmute the stream. The icon will appear as a speaker with an x through it if the stream is muted. Beside the speaker is a Progress Bar that the user can use to control the level of the volume. A bar is located on the Progress Bar for the user to move left and right to control the volume. The percentage of the volume is shown by the color of the bar. If the bar is all grey the stream is muted and if the bar is all purple the stream is at max volume.</p>
                  <p>On the bottom right hand side of the screen rests 4 icons. The first icon, the furthest left icon on the bottom right of the player, is the Settings button. When the Settings button is pressed a small box appears over the bottom right icons. Inside the box, users have the option to change the resolution of the video, pop the video player out into another window, report an issue with the video, and gives users an advanced options tab. The advanced options allow for users to turn off the html5 player, remove the mini player that pops out for users when they browse and show stats regarding the video. </p>
                  <p>The icon beside the clip icon allows the user to put the site into theater mode. This mode increases the size of the video player when not in full screen, darkens the screen to make it easier on the user’s eyes and displays the chat room neatly beside the video. When in Theater Mode a button appears at the top right of the screen, giving the user an option to cover the chatroom with the video player. After the user clicks the Theater Mode button, the Theater Mode button then turns into an Exit Theater Mode button.</p>
                  <p>The last button on the bottom right is a Fullscreen button. The icon appears to be one arrow facing the top left corner of the screen and the other arrow facing the bottom right of the screen. The arrows face inwards when Fullscreen is active. Also, when Fullscreen is active, the Theater Mode button disappears.</p>

                  <h3> HBO GO </h3>
                  <p>Like the sites above, the video player’s icons disappear when the mouse is inactive for a second or removed from the view of the player. </p>
                  <p>The video player has a similar setup as the above sites. It has the typical Progress Bar, Play Button and Volume Button, so I will start by discussing some of the unique features/ interesting setup options.</p>
                  <p>This video player has a share button and a Watch Next Button. The Share Button looks like a typical arrow button, commonly used to represent sharing or sending. The Watch Next button has the icon of an ellipsis. Both of the buttons are placed beside each other at the top right hand side of the screen.</p>
                  <p>Once the Share Button is pressed a new the video player display changes to give options to the user for sharing. At the top right hand corner of the screen is an x wrapped with a circle to symbolize closing the share option. Once the Close Button is pressed the user is take back to the regular video player and video. If the user clicked to pause the video and then pressed the share button, the video will still be paused when the user closes the Share options. If the video was playing, the video will be paused while the user is selecting options from the Share screen and will start playing again as soon as the Share screen is closed. Inside the Share options, the video is darkened slightly and covered with some text and icons.</p>
                  <p>At the top middle of the screen is the word Share in bold white and below share is the title of the video in light grey, not bolded. In the middle of the screen is a list of all options HBO allows it’s users to share their video. The icons slightly highlight when hovered over. From left to right the share options are Facebook, Twitter, Email and Embedding the video. When you press the Embed video button, the button highlights completely yellow and displays the url in a text box below the icons. The Share screen and Watch Next screen both contain a resume play button at the bottom left of the screen and, at the bottom right of the screen, an option for Watch Next/ Share alternating depending on the user’s current screen. </p>

                  <p>There are two bars of note at the bottom of the screen. The Progress Bar and the Toolbar. The Progress Bar is displayed as a yellow and gray line. The yellow line shows how far the user has progressed during the video. The gray shows how much of the video is left for the user to watch. The Tool Bar is below the Progress Bar. At the bottom left of the screen, on the Toolbar, is the Play Button. The Play Button toggles from and arrow to two white bars to indicate whether the video is paused or not. Beside the Play Button, to the right is the Volume Controls. When the user presses the Speaker Icon the volume toggles from mute to unmute. If the user hovers of the speaker icon a progress bar will appear left of the speaker giving the user manual control of the volume.</p>
                  <p>Beside the Volume Controls on the right is time at which the video is at over the amount of time total the video is. On the bottom right of the Toolbar is the fullscreen button.</p>
