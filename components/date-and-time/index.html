<p class="lead"> Contained in almost any device, the date and time component is meant to display your current time with correct timezone and specific parameters. These parameters can range from a preference in military time, to including a second counter as well.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>If a component is sufficiently widespread that it takes on a recognizable look across multiple platforms,
  provide it here. If its appearance varies extremely widely, say so and direct the reader to platform-specific
  instances.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Date and Time objects provide the user with the ability to store references to particular instances in time. They can be broken down into parts and manipulated accordingly (hour, minutes, seconds, month, day, year, etc.). Different timezones and particular calendars, such as a Hebrew calendar, can also be applied/referenced.

  </p>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>The <em>date</em> component represents an invariant point in time, which implies that date is a combination of a clock <em>time</em> and a day on a particular calendar. We use a particular calendar, (the Buddhist calendar for example) to decompose the date object into its’ different components like year, month, day, hour and minute. This provides a means for comparing dates, creating a new date from a time interval relative to another date, and calculating the interval of time between two dates.</blockquote>


<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

  <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

  <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
    usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
    however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
  viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
  it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
  state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

<p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
  implementations, but in general they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
    change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
    additional activity is performed.</li>

  <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
    the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
    from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<blockquote>

  <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>

  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>
</p>

<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>The date and time components on any platform can be used to create <em>events</em> in the calendar applications on specific calendars, in specific timezones. They can also be used to set <em>alarms</em> in the clock applications for specific days of the week. See the Platform-Specific Instances for more information on each platform's specific variants.</blockquote>


<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>In regards to usability metrics, it is important to note that the date and time component does not prioritize all five of Nielsen's five quality components (metrics) of usability. That being said, the date and time component on a machine prioritizes learnability and errors. But also addresses the memorability, efficiency, and satisfaction of its design.</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Learnability: </strong>As one of the top prioritized metrics of usability, the interface of date and time components across the majority of platforms house many useful features that cater to first-time users. One these features includes the visual representation of a calendar and clock for date and time (respectively). Date and time component also provide simple features in order to change both date and time. Most interfaces feature a input form that allows the user to either type in a specific time/date, or they may use the up and down arrows located next to the input field to increment the date/time. The visual representation of a calendar allows users to click on specific dates, as well as scroll through different months, and on some platforms, years. This familiarity provided by the visual representations coupled with the implementation of simple components such as an input field and a clickable calendar allow the ability to use the component to be easily picked up by first-time users.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Errors: </strong>Equally as important as learnability, error prevention is prioritized when it comes to the date and time component. This is because users are heavily dependent on the date and time that are displayed on a machine. The visual representations provided on the interface also allow users to affirm the changes they make to the date or time. Users may be more familiar with seeing the date on a physical calendar or seeing the time on a physical clock, therefore visual representaions allow those users to confirm the correctness of their modifications to the date or to the time, preventing errors. Being able to resolve user errors is also a crucical part of this metric. The component may also include a feature for setting the date and time automatically depending on the machine's location and timezone. In the case that a user changes the date and time incorrectly, this feature serves as a one-click method to correcting the change.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Memorability: </strong>Memorability may not be one of the top priority metrics, however, it still is deemed important as the date and time component isn't an item that'll be frequently visited by users, especially if the machine does include the feature of setting the date and time automatically based on location. That being said, its vital that the user is still able to use the component despite a substantial period without its use. Familiarity plays a role in reestablishing proficiency in the use of a design. The visual representations, specifically the calendar, can remind users of the interactivity when making changes to the date and time. The up and down arrows located next to the input form suggest the logic of making changes (up to increase/increment and down to decrease/decrement). Similarly to the errors metric, how a date and time is formatted and displayed can also hint to users how to modify specific parts of a date or a time.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Efficiency: </strong>The efficiency of the date and time component is not as prioritized due to the fact that the component is not typically visited and used often.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Satisfaction: </strong>Satisfaction is considered the least prioritized when it comes to the usability metrics because users are more concerned with being satisfied with the result of the component, rather than the functionality of it. However, this does not mean that this metric is fully dismissed, as each of the prioritization of the metrics above also fill into addressing satisfaction, as the more learnable, less error prone, and memorable a machine, the more satisfying its functionality is likely to be.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
    the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
    buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
    for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

  <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
    on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
    more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
    explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

  <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
    may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
    folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

  <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
    interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
    user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
    might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
    platform-specific user interface component.</p>

        <p>The date and time component's appearance has, for the most part, stayed consistent throughout macOS's (previously branded as Mac OS X) recent software updates. The interface that is presented includes three different tabs: "Date & Time", "Time Zone", and "Clock". Each tab includes its own assortment of settings and preferences that can be modified by the user to their liking.</p>
