<p class="lead">visual representations of geographic space, maps have, with the advent of mobile technology, become essential interface components in a wide range of applications.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>Across platforms, maps demonstrate a number of common characteristics in their appearance. Namely, maps will give some indication of the scale at which they are currently being viewed, a means of marking points of interest, some mark which denotes the location of the user, and a rendered representation of the geography to which the map corresponds (either in drawn-map form or satellite form).</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The primary function of any embedded map is to demonstrate some location in space. Maps implement behaviors such as:
  <ul>
    <li><em>Movement</em>: the ability to zoom, pan, and rotate the map (sometimes in 3-D space)</li>
    <li><em>Search</em>: the ability to search for particular locations in the map</li>
    <li><em>Marking</em>: the ability to point to and mark locations of interest</li>
    <li><em>Directions</em>: maps typically implement a routing function that will display to the user a route between two points</li>
    <li><em>Snap to Current Location</em>: maps allow the user to snap to their immediate surroundings</li>
  </ul> 
  </p>

  <p>Helpful subsections include:</p>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
  highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

      <p><em>The Grab</em>: initiated by <code>mouse button down</code></p>
      <p>The grab event is initiated when the user clicks and holds their click at any non-special location on the map. The Grab is accompanied by a small piece of feedback in the form of a cursor change (at least on macOS).</p>
      <p><em>The Pan</em>: Maintained while <code>mouse button down</code></p>
      <p>While the user has grabbed the map, she may move her mouse in any direction to have the map pan in the direction of the movement. The movement of the map essentially happens in real time along with the movement of the mouse.</p>
      <p><em>The Release</em>: initiated by <code>mouse button release</code></p>
      <p>User-controlled map panning is completed when the user releases their mouse button. Depending on the implementation, the map may continue to move in the direction of its momentum when the mouse was released.</p>

      <p><em>Get Directions to/from Specified Location</em>: initiated by <code>click</code></p>
      <p>The get directions to/from specified location event presents a menu where the user must enter the opposite end of their journey (origin/destination respectively). This location may be selected either by a Drop Pin event or by a search result.</p>
      <p><em>Origin/Destination Selection</em>: initiated by <code>enterText</code></p>
      <p>The Origin/Destination Selection event takes a text input from the user in the corresponding text input box. As the user inputs her text, relevant location options will display. The user must enter an exact location or select from the presented location options to finalize their origin/destination selection.</p>
      <p><em>Display Directions</em>: initiated by <code>submit</code></p>
      <p>The event causes the map to draw a route between a chosen starting location and the specified location upon submission of these locations. Along with displaying the recommended route, the map will additionally present the user with an estimated time that the route would take. Some implementations allow for a different choice of route, and some display different routes depending on the user's preference for walking, public transit, or driving (e.g. Google and Apple Maps)</p>

<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

  <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

  <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
    usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
    however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
  viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
  it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
  state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

<p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
  implementations, but in general they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
    change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
    additional activity is performed.</li>

  <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
    the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
    from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Embedded or linked video (by you or by others [and if by others give credit]) showing the component in action.</p>

  <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>

<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-default">Standard Bootstrap Button</button>
  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>
</p>

  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
<h3>Variants</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Embedded Maps</em> appear very similar to a full-featured map implementations, but typically restrict the availability of user interactions. For example, embedded maps on Thrillist.com do not permit the user to search for locations other than bars and restaurants, to drop pins, or to get directions. These behaviors vary from site to site.

        <img src="thrillist-embedded.gif" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded">
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Some behaviors allowed on a map embedded on thrillist.com</figcaption>
      </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
<h4>Learnability</h4>
<p>The ease with which users learn to make use of a map implementation should not be prioritized relative to metrics such as efficiency, errors, and satisfaction; as long as an implementation of the map component is reasonably intuitive, users should have no trouble learning how to use it.</p>

<h4>Efficiency</h4>
<p>Efficiency must be highly prioritized by any implementation of the map component. Especially in mobile maps, users will desire practically instant access to directional information to get wherever it is they desire to be. If an experienced user has difficulty accessing geographic information in an efficient manner, they will likely become frustrated and possibly migrate to a different map application</p>

<h4>Memorability</h4>
<p>Because most technology users access geographic information on a regular basis, little emphasis should be placed on the memorability metric of map interfaces. The importance of memorability is again reduced by the relative simplicity of most map interfaces, which should not require too much memorization of operations for the typical user. The memorability metric may be considered more important in complex map implementations such as arcGis, but people tend to use such applications in a professional capacity, meaning that their use will likely be more regular and thus memorability a less important measure of usability.</p>

<h4>Errors</h4>
<p>A low error rate characterizes a properly usable implementation of a map interface; this relative importance can again be attributed to the prevalance of map components on mobile technologies. Mobile users of maps may be in motion when making use of a map interface, meaning that the safety of the user and of those around them could be compromised with each additional unexpected result.</p>

<h4>Satisfaction</h4>
<p>User satisfaction is always an important measure of usability, and maps are no different. Especially in the crowded space of map applications, all of which serve relatively the same function, developers must prioritize satisfaction in order to differentiate their implementation from those of their competitors.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>

<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>Maps are populated with a great deal of information, so in order to make users best able to understand the effects of their actions, any and all feedback must convey all relevant information in a manner both visible and simple.</p>

<h4>Visibility</h4>
<p>Some elements of visibility can be considered feedback, but others are distinct in their own right. Users must be able to easily identify both the features of the map itself and the signifiers of actions available to the user at any given time. Because maps can communicate so much information at once, the ability of the user to discern what they can and cannot interact with while at the same time remaining capable of interpreting the geographic information of the map is essential.</p>

<h4>Intuitive Affordances</h4>
<p>Maps communicate fundamentally physical information, thus interactions with a well-formed map component should mimic interactions with a physical object in order to best align with users' mental models regarding maps. This type of behavior can be seen in almost all popular map implementations; for example, Google Maps allows users to pan around the map as though they were manipulating a physical object, rather than only being able to do so with arrow keys or some kind of button interface.</p>

</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
    the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
    buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
    for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

  <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
    on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
    more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
    explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

  <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
    may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
    folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

  <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
    interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
    user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
    might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
    platform-specific user interface component.</p>
