<p class="lead">The scrolling feature is one of the most commonly used behavioral component on modern interfaces. By scrolling, users can manipulate their location on a page (both vertically and horizontally) to see content that lies beyond the dimensions of their current display.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>The scrollbar has one generally-accepted appearance: a tray on the right side of the computer screen in which a slightly off-colored block, known as the scroll thumb, rests. The shape and color of the tray and thumb vary across different platforms.</blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The action of scrolling up or down is universal. The user can move, or scroll, an entire page of content  
     up or down by manipulating the scroll thumb (or one of the variants provided lower). Users can change the 
     direction of their scroll in their settings - this will be discussed further in variants and platform-specific
     instances. </p>

</blockquote>

<p> Across most devices, the scroll thumb will adjust in size to give the user an indication on the size of the document. 
    This is a helpful form of feedback for the amount of content on any given page. A possible complaint, however, resides
    in the event that a page has an inordinate amount of content; in this scenario, the scroll thumb becomes very small and
    difficult to manipulate for some users. </p>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
  highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

<p> Using the scrollbar component, the most relevant scrolling event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event
    indicates that the user has selected the scrollbar thumb. Secondary events include <code>hover</code>, indicating that a pointing device is explicitly within the bounds of the scrollbar thumb. In the event that the user clicks and holds a scrollbar, the <code>release</code> event is applicable. </p>

<p> The scrollbar will highlight during a <code>hover</code> event and then highlight brighter upon being clicked. This
    provides a form of feedback that indicates scrollbar response upon additional activity performed. </p>

<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

  <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

  <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
    usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
    however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
  viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
  it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
  state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

<p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
  implementations, but in general they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
    change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
    additional activity is performed.</li>

  <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
    the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
    from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>

<h3>Variants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Two Finger Scrolling</em> <br>
      Two finger scrolling, originally introduced by Apple, is a new and more efficient way to scroll through pages on
      laptops. Although it is an easier tool to use, it is difficult to learn how it works because it is not intuitive. When
      users scroll down with two fingers on the trackpad, they expect the page to go down. Similarly, when they scroll up, they
      anticipate the page will move upwards. This intuition is formed by the way the scroll bar is designed. However, both OS X
      and Windows 10 introduce two finger scrolling in the opposite manner. This can make it harder and more frustrating for
      users to adjust to the change. On the other hand, once users are acclimated with this adjustment, it is easier to
      remember how it works, and they are less likely to forget how to use it; essentially, it becomes second nature.</li>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
  metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

  <ul>
  <li><em>Learnability</em></li>
  <li><em>Efficiency</em></li>
  <li><em>Memorability</em></li>
  <li><em>Errors</em></li>
  <li><em>Satisfaction</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
  all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
  the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
  priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

<p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
  almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

<p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
  a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
  prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
    the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
    buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
    for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

  <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
    on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
    more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
    explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

  <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
    may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
    folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

  <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
    interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
    user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
    might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
    platform-specific user interface component.</p>
