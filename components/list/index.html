<p class="lead">Graphical user interface to visually display a list or array
        of data. A common interaction that adds utility in mobile devices.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">

                <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>


                <p>The list from an interaction design perspective has a very literal appearance,
                normally with a light colored background, and thin black bordered rows.
                Most lists tend to be navigable, with the title of the list, and an option to
                add more entries. Lists can be found in various applications that involve
                displaying a "list" or set of data. This data can be shown in an alphabetical
                order such as a list of contacts or unordered like a list of groceries. </p>

                <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

                <p>Able to view or display a certain amount of elements at a time. Add or
                delete entries from anywhere on the list. List normally have a title
                associated to describe the purpose of the list. List can describe procedures
                in an ordered fashion or display data with bullet points in an unordered
                fashion.</p>



                <h4>Events</h4>


                <p>Adding or deleting an element to a list is an example of a event.
                Users can specify if they wish the list to be ordered or unordered. The
                user may wish to sort their list using user-defined conditions. A element
                of a list can be <code>highlighted</code> or <code>disabled</code>. A
                <code>tag</code> can be added to element of a list to display modifications
                or activity.</p>

                <h4> Highlighted List State:</h4>
                <p> Often times, an element on a list may be highlighted to show the user
                that the element is currently selected or active.</p>

                <blockquote>

                <h3>Variants</h3>

                <blockquote>Lists are a very basic way to group together items that have some overarching similarity. The simplicity is the lists strength as well as its weakness.
                Many other interface elements have become variants to lists because they offer more versatility in their design.
                Some of these variants are listed<!-- (no pun intended) --> below:
                </blockquote>


                <li><em>Menus </em> are very close to the look of a list generally displaying a various amount of elements. A distinct difference between a list and
                menu is the menu items can be clicked on for a event to take place. Also another major difference between menus and lists is a menu item can also
                be a menu its self.</li>


                <h4>Vertical Navigation Menu</h4>

                <ul id="vert-list">
                    <li><a href="#home" class="list-link">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#news" class="list-link">News</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#contact" class="list-link">Contact</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#about" class="list-link">About</a></li>
                </ul>

                <li><em>Tables</em> A table is very similar to a list and even can be considered a list if the table is only displaying a group of elements all under
                the same category. It however is often the case that a table is displaying a grouping of lists to see how the titles of those lists are correlated
                in any way. Tables also create more structure and can't be unordered. </li>

                <h4>List Table Variant</h4>
                <table class = "table table-striped" style="width:100%">
                    <thead class="thead-inverse">

                <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

                <blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
                metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

                <p>Practically every user interface uses lists whether its to organize data or to display further actions a user can take. When considering priority metrics with lists, its important to distinguish the variants that lists have an how those variant may have different priorities in terms of functionality.</p>

                <p>In the previous section, it was shown how a list may take up a menu functionality. In this case it would be important for the user to recognize that the menu or list is interactable. Therefore learnablility and memorability become a critical factor. The list becomes a navigable element, thus it should have a label or title relevant to where it directs a user if he or she interacts with it. The list would not be effective if it created many errors where a user mistakenly interpreted its elements.</p>
                <p>However, with other variants, the list consists of different priorities. If a list is implemented to display a table of data which in this case is now non-interactive; learnability, memorability, and errors are no longer as significant. For this list, its sole purpose is to display data in an organizable fashion. </p>
                <p>Perhaps the lowest priorities for a list would be satisfaction and efficiency. The lists serves a utilitarian component that has no value of enjoyment for the user but to simply display its elements. There is no reason for a user to become "efficient" with using a list since it has very low complexity.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics</h3> <!-- i do dis-->

                <blockquote>What makes for a good <em>List</em>? Here are some acceptable layouts and behaviors.
                </blockquote>
                The consensus between both Google and Microsoft is that a proper list
                is a single column, made up of rows whos primary function is to hold text. Specifically,
                Microsoft says, lists are for "Displaying content collections that are primarily text".
                This is not to say lists cannot hold other data types, however there are better
                choices if the primary data type is other than text. (i.e. grids are better for images)
                <h5>For example, here is an acceptable usage of lists with heterogeneous data types: </h5>
                <blockquote><img src = "MaterialDesignInbox.png" alt="example" class="img-responsive center-blocks" width="250" height="250"/>
                  <font face="" font size="2">Note that each row primarily houses text.</font>
                </blockquote>

                </p>
                Furthermore, it is well understood that lists only scroll vertically, read top to
                bottom, and are single column. Without these features, a list is hopelessly inadequate.  Therefore,
                some good implementations of lists would be for messaging, settings, contacts or, surprisingly,
                any set of textual data that intuitively fits into a list.

                </p>
                Keeping consistency in mind between each row is incredibly important.
                Guidelines by Apple, Microsoft, and Google, all indicate that the text's font between
                each row should be the same.  Each cell should display the content in a uniform way,
                the picture above again serves as a good example.  Notice how each contact image
                is lined up with the previous row, and the font is all the same.
            </div>
        </div>

            <h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
                the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
                buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
                for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

                <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
                on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
                more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
                explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

                <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
                may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
                folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

                <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
                interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
                user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
                might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
                platform-specific user interface component.</p>

                                    <h5>Typical Appearance</h5>
                                    <p>On iOS devices, lists tend to have a title that describes what the list represents.
                                    On most lists there is an "add" button, mostly on the upper-right corner that allows
                                    users to add an item to the list. In many cases on each row, there is an arrow indicating that by touching the element, more details may be revealed.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Typical Behavior</h5>
                                    <p>Direct manipulation is a defining interface for iOS devices, therefore lists contain direct manipulation as well. Swiping on a row of a list may reveal an option to delete that row of data. Tapping on an add entry button will allow users to directly insert data and insert this new row into the list. Users can also swipe the screen of the lists to scroll through the lists. With Siri on iOS devices, users can also use natural language to manipulate data on lists. For example, a user can instruct Siri to add a new reminder to a pre-existing list of reminders, and what the reminder should say.</p>
