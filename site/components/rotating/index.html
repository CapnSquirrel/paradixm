<p class="lead">Rotating allows for manipulation of single applications and media between portrait and landscape modes, often unlocking a new user interface and access to landscape-specific features.</p>

    <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>
    <blockquote>Appearance generally differs. For operating systems like OS X and Windows, rotating the display screen
     is done through a drop down menu. For software like Preview and word processors, it also varies. Some objects are
     rotated through a button or an icon. Nevertheless, both styles are indicative enough to exemplify rotation.</blockquote>
    <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>
    <blockquote>Rotating is widely known and applied to objects in order to change their orientation or move in a circle-like
     motion around their center of mass. The flexibility of rotation surely enough differs from object to object. Depending on the software,
     some objects can rotate by fixed amounts, such as intervals of 90 degrees, and some can precisely rotate from 0 to 360 degrees. </blockquote>

      <h4>Events</h4>
      <blockquote>Depending on the OS and software being used, rotating can be performed through multiple ways, such as buttons and swiping.
       Therefore, the events overlap with other events that pertain to different user interface components.</blockquote>
      <p> When rotating is done through buttons, a <code>click</code> event occurs. Other events
        include <code>click and drag</code> , which usually allows the user to rotate an object however they would like as done with word
        processing applications and Mac's 'Grapher' application. Though there are multiple ways to perform rotating, ultimately,
        a <code>rotate</code> event occurs and indicates that an object was rotated.</p>
      <p class="text-left">On iOS, rotation and accelerometer movement is measured by: <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>pitch</code>, <code>roll</code>, and <code>yaw</code>. These can be defined as follows: </p>
      <ul>

          <img src="axis.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Axis" style="height: auto; width: 60%">
        </div>
        <li><code>x, y, z</code>: Rotations about the x, y, and z axis.</li>
        <li><code>pitch</code>: Face up or face down rotating about an axis running from each side of the device.</li>
        <li><code>roll</code>: Rotation about an axis from the top of the phone to the bottom side.</li>
        <li><code>yaw</code>: Rotation from either side of the device to the top or bottom.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>State Diagram</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The following diagram shows the three states an object undergoes during rotation. This is only applicable to OSes and software that supports rotation for 2D and/or 3D objects.</p>

    <h3>Variants</h3>
  <blockquote>Rotation is used to multiple applications across many different operating systems. Sometimes, it is not very obvious that an element can be manipulated by rotation. Depending on the category of device, the intended rotation method varies. For example, laptop computers often use the trackpad to rotate elements, while mobile phones use an accelerometer, allowing for the entire device to be rotated to manipulate an element.</blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Photos</em> can often be rotated an manipulated by using the correct rotation method depending on the device. On iOS, photos can be rotated by rotating the entire device, or simple pinching with two fingers to move the photo using Multitouch.</li>
    <li><em>Single Applications</em> often change their entire UI when the device is rotated. For example, the Calculator application on iOS changes from a simple calculator to a full scientific calculator when rotated into landscape mode.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>
  <blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
  metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>
  <p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
    all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
    the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
  priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>
  <p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
    almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>
  <p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
    a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
    prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>
  <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
  <blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
    Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>
  <h4>Feedback</h4>
  <p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
    <li>they successfully <em>canceled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Rotation is an aspect that varies quite a bit depending on the class of the device. Mobile devices, such as an iOS device, have a lot more functionality when it comes to rotation because of the <em>accelerometer.</em> This component allows many different applications to interact with the current orientation of the device. Because of this added component, there are a lot more things to consider when looking at rotation in iOS devices.</p>

      <p>The <em>accelerometer</em> is used to determine whether to display the user interface as portrait or landscape mode. Applications often have a user interface specifically for landscape mode, or at least have relevant elements change to recognize the user is in landscape mode. This can be disabled by navigating to <em>Control Center</em> and pressing the <em>Orientation Lock</em> icon. This will disable all use of the accelerometer, thus disabling all rotation function in iOS.</p>

      <p>In iOS, rather than using a trackpad to manipulate elements, iOS devices can be physically rotated to switch between orientations. Single elements in some applications, such as photos, can be rotated either by rotating the device or using a pinch with two fingers.</p>

      <p class="text-right">In iOS 9, Apple added a Parallax Effect feature to the iOS homescreen and lockscreen. This allows the user's wallpaper to be manipulated by the orientation of their device to give a 3-dimensional effect to the wallpaper. This feature can be disabled by navigating to Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.</p>
      <p>iOS applications can have separate user interfaces for portrait and landscape modes. An example of this is iOS' native <em>Calculator</em> application. <em>Calculator</em> changes from a simple calculator in portrait mode to a full-featured scientific calculator when the device is rotated.</p>

      <img src="apple-calculator-landscape.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Calculator Landscape" style="height: auto; width: 80%">
      <p>However, not all iOS applications feature UI changes in landscape mode. For example, many camera applications recognize orientation changes and automatically prepare the camera for taking a landscape photo. Though this has minimal user interface changes, rotation is still being used in this instance.</p>
      <img src="horiz-vid.gif" class="img-responsive" alt="Landscape Video" style="height: auto; width: auto">
      <p> Many applications are intended for use only in portrait mode, and have no support for landscape viewing.</p>
