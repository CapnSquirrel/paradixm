<p class="lead">Tables are a manner of data representation similar to lists which organize elements by means of rows and columns. This allows for efficient organization of data elements and their properties. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>As mentioned earlier, any form of data representation that makes use of columns and rows can be termed a table. While the overall structure of tables tends to remain uniform across platforms, there may be several aesthetic differences between table representations. Images may be used in conjunction with data, rows or elements may appear selectable, etc.</blockquote>


<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two kinds of separate behaviors that are typically seen in tables.</p>

  <p>The first is that of a read-only data table used simply to showcase data in a grid. Some platforms may allow for sorting of the contents within by alphabetical order, creation/modification date, etc.</p>

  <p>The second is data entry tables, in which a user is welcome to input content into the grid. Depending on the table's functionality, inputs may be able to affect or directly address the contents of other cells within the row/column grid (Notable examples of this kind of behavior are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets).</p>

  <p>These behaviors may overlap depending on the platform or application in use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
  highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

<p>The most relevant button event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the user has
  triggered the button. Secondary events include <code>hover</code>, indicating that a pointing device is explicitly
  within the button’s bounds.</p>

<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

  <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

  <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
    usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
    however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
  viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
  it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
  state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

<p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
  implementations, but in general they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
    change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
    additional activity is performed.</li>

  <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
    the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
    from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

  <blockquote><p>A typical read-only table is shown below, listing the hex values corresponding to the primary colors.</p>  </blockquote>

<p class="text-center">
    <table class = "table">
        <caption>Basic Color Table</caption>   
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Color</th>
                <th>Hex Value</th>
            </tr>     
        </thead>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Red</td>
                <td>#FF0000</td>
            </tr>
      
            <tr>
                <td>Green</td>
                <td>#00FF00</td>
            </tr>
      
            <tr>
                <td>Blue</td>
                <td>#0000FF</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>    
        </table>
</p>

<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>There is almost never just one form of a user interface component. Use this section to address variations
  on this theme. Some variations are sufficiently different that they are considered to be a different component
  entirely, despite very similar behavior. Meanwhile some variations are due to appearance only.</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Menu items</em> are very close to buttons in behavior—they perform individual action elements upon simple
    invocation by a user. However, they belong to a broader context/structure of a menu, and look sufficiently
    different that they are both conceptually and programmatically viewed as distinct from buttons.</li>

  <li><em>Links</em> can be considered as a specialized button—they are invoked almost identically, and their action
    is even more narrowly defined as moving the user to a different view or display. The distinction here is
    definitely less sharp than the distinction between a menu item and a button. For links within a document, the
    document might be viewed as a menu in itself, and thus links are “menu items” indicating what the user can view
    next. Thus, in some ways, links are hybrids between buttons and menu items.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
  metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

<p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
  all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
  the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
  priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

<p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
  almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

<p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
  a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
  prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
    the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
    buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
    for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

  <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
    on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
    more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
    explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

  <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
    may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
    folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

  <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
    interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
    user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
    might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
    platform-specific user interface component.</p>
