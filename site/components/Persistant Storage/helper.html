<blockquote>This file is meant to serve as a template sample for articles in the Paradixm component catalog.
  Instructions/directives are presented in block quotes and sample text is included in line, as if it were actual
  content for this page. Section headings are not samples but actual recommended titles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Start your component pages with a quick description of the component, such as:</blockquote>

<p class="lead">Persistant storage is probably one of the most important aspects for user interface because it is a place where you store and keep files. If one cannot find a file they need that could be predicament.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">

<h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p> 
        In Mac OS X the main form for user interface for persistant storage is finder. The finder helps keep your files and folders as well as devices. </p>
        <IMG SRC = "finderPic.png" ALT = "picture of Finder" style="width:360px;height:228px;"> 
  <p>      
    Another way to naviagte through persitant storage is through the terminal. </p>
        <IMG SRC = "Terminal.png" ALT = "picture of Terminal">
  <p>
    Another way is through the _removable_ like when you have a usb inserted
  </p>
   <IMG SRC = "remove.png" ALT = "removeable image">
  </blockquote>

<h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Persistant Storage's typical behavior is that it can be accessed through  varies ways and exists throughout all platforms. When a person saves a file to store that is a behavior for persistant storage. Another is when someone puts in a usb into the computer and either puts a file in the usb or takes a file out and wants to copy it to their desktop. </p>

  <p>Helpful subsections include: </p>

<h4>Events</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>A few basic events are finding a file, creating a file, deleting a file, copy and pasting a file, and drag and drop.Many of these events require an intermediary step that requires you to do something that technically isn't part of the persistant storage. An example is when you delete a file you have to right click the file first and then press the receycle button or something of the sort.</p>
<p>Find a file is pretty basic you can usually use a search bar or you can go to the location. You can do this multiple ways such as just looking through finder till you find the the file or doing it through the terminal. </p>
<p> Creating a file is also pretty simple it usually just saving a file. Ex. Open a Microsoft file and write the words "Hello World" and then click Save As and save the file where you would like to save it.</p>
<p>Deleting a file is again another easy event where a person usually right clicks the file and then presses "move to thrash" or "Delete File" or one can also drag and drop the file into the thrash and it usually is move there.</p>
<p>Copying and pasting a file is another way persistant storage works. One has to first copy the file then naviagte through the persistant storage and then paste it where they want into the persistant storage. </p></blockquote>

<h4>State Diagram</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

  <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>
  <IMG SRC = "stateDiagram.png" ALT = "basic state Diagarm">
  <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
    usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
    however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
  viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
  it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
  state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

<p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
  implementations, but in general they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
    change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
    additional activity is performed.</li>

  <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
    the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
    from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Component in Action</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Embedded or linked video (by you or by others [and if by others give credit]) showing the component in action.</p>

  <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="text-center">
  <button class="btn btn-default">Standard Bootstrap Button</button>
  <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>
</p>

  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
<h3>Variants</h3>

<blockquote>There is almost never just one form of a user interface component. Use this section to address variations
  on this theme. Some variations are sufficiently different that they are considered to be a different component
  entirely, despite very similar behavior. Meanwhile some variations are due to appearance only.</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><em>Databases</em> are a type of persistant storage. One can navigate through a database through various ways an example of one would be Giphy and using the search bar to go through the information and find the information one was looking for</li>

  <li><em>Links</em> can be considered as a specialized button—they are invoked almost identically, and their action
    is even more narrowly defined as moving the user to a different view or display. The distinction here is
    definitely less sharp than the distinction between a menu item and a button. For links within a document, the
    document might be viewed as a menu in itself, and thus links are “menu items” indicating what the user can view
    next. Thus, in some ways, links are hybrids between buttons and menu items.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

<blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
  metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

<p>Persistant storage does have a learnability curve. One must first learn where all the folder and files are located and when doing something such as saving or downloading where the file or folder is places. Also if you were to do it through the terminal using the commands such as cd and ls to find and acquire the file wanted does requiring learning and memory to remember where everything is and where it can be accessed from. </p>

<p>Users may experience del (efficiency), particularly because using a button
  almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
  mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

<p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
  a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
  prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
  As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

<blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
  Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
  principles.</blockquote>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
  never doubt whether:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
  <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
    the action that triggers the button</li>
</ol>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
    the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
    buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
    for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

  <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
    on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
    more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
    explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

  <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
    may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
    folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

  <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
    interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
    user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
    might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
    platform-specific user interface component.</p>
