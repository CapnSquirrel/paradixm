<blockquote>This file is meant to serve as a template sample for articles in the Paradixm component catalog.
  Instructions/directives are presented in block quotes and sample text is included in line, as if it were actual
  content for this page. Section headings are not samples but actual recommended titles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Start your component pages with a quick description of the component, such as:</blockquote>

<p class="lead">The web component is an embedded web page view of a website or an application home page mode.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>

      <blockquote>A typical appearence of Web can be seen in client-side applications where an embedded page view is present. Usually in a window that can be manipulated, with sizing options available to change width and height.</blockquote>

      <p>An example of a typical appearence of a web object can be seen here with the Wells Fargo and Google client for iOS:</p>
    </div> 

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <img src="facebookiOS.png" style="width: 40%">
      <img src="googleiOS.png" style="width: 40%">
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <p>If a component is sufficiently widespread that some form of typical behavior can be described, describe it
          here. As with the “Typical Appearance” section, if there is no such consistent behavior, say as much and direct the
          reader to the platform-specific sections.</p>

        <p>Helpful subsections include:</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Events</h4>

      <blockquote>An <em>event</em> is something that can happen to a user interface component. They are both conceptual and
        highly concrete in that events very frequently translate directly into a user interface component’s API.</blockquote>

      <p>The most relevant button event is the <code>click</code>. A <code>click</code> event indicates that the user has
        triggered the button. Secondary events include <code>hover</code>, indicating that a pointing device is explicitly
        within the button’s bounds.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>State Diagram</h4>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A state diagram indicating the actions and states of a user interface component.</p>

      <p>This is most likely an image. Bonus props if you use SVG.</p>

      <p>And also, a state diagram implies, well, <em>states</em>. So be sure to describe them. Note also that there will
        usually be overlap between a component’s events and its state diagram. A sufficiently detailed state diagram,
        however, may have more activities than the “public” events that can be reported by a component.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Most button designs have the following states. The <code>enabled</code> and <code>disabled</code> states can be
      viewed as “dormant” button states—they are the only states that a button can have when a user is not interacting with
      it. The <code>enabled</code> state means that a user <em>can</em> interact with it, while the <code>disabled</code>
      state means that a user <em>cannot</em> do so.</p>

    <p>When a button is <code>enabled</code>, additional states may be triggered. Not all states are present in all button
      implementations, but in general they are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>hover</code>: For platforms with an explicit pointing element, positioning that element over a button may
        change the button’s appearance. This provides a form of feedback that states that the button will respond if
        additional activity is performed.</li>

      <li><code>armed</code>: If the user initiates button-triggered behavior, such as a click on mouse-capable systems,
        the button may enter a state indicating that it is ready to be invoked. Many button implementations allow an “out”
        from this state, in case the user changes his or her mind in mid-action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Component in Action</h4>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Embedded or linked video (by you or by others [and if by others give credit]) showing the component in action.</p>

      <p>For components that are available on a web platform, you can embed an actual component right here, such as:</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="text-center">
      <button class="btn btn-default">Standard Bootstrap Button</button>
      <button class="btn btn-default disabled">Disabled Bootstrap Button</button>
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h3>Variants</h3>

      <blockquote>Web views vary greatly in their appearence and uses across platforms and services. Almost all pages differ from each other in ways to reflect the web services content.</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><em>iOS</em> web views are much different than their desktop/laptop counterparts. They tend to bring up full page inside their app, of which these apps frequently defer to what is really a login web page in the given service, but the login looks like it is "inside" the app</li>

        <li><em>Mac</em> </li>
      </ul>
    </div>  

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

      <blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
        metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

      <p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
        all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
        the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
        priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

      <p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
        almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
        mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

      <p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
        a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
        prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
        As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

      <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

      <blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
        Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
        principles.</blockquote>

      <h4>Feedback</h4>

      <p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
        never doubt whether:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
        <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
          the action that triggers the button</li>
      </ol>
    </div>  
  </div>
</div>

  <h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
      the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
      buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
      for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

    <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
      on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
      more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
      explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

    <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
      may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
      folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

    <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
      interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
      user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
      might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
      platform-specific user interface component.</p>
