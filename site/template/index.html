<p class="lead">Graphical user interface to visually display a list or array
        of data. A common interaction that adds utility in mobile devices.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">

                <h3>Typical Appearance</h3>


                <p>The list from an interaction design perspective has a very literal appearance,
                normally with a light colored background, and thin black bordered rows.
                Most lists tend to be navigable, with the title of the list, and an option to
                add more entries. Lists can be found in various applications that involve
                displaying a "list" or set of data. This data can be shown in an alphabetical
                order such as a list of contacts or unordered like a list of groceries. </p>

                <h3>Typical Behavior</h3>

                <p>Able to view or display a certain amount of elements at a time. Add or
                delete entries from anywhere on the list. List normally have a title
                associated to describe the purpose of the list. List can describe procedures
                in an ordered fashion or display data with bullet points in an unordered
                fashion.</p>



                <h4>Events</h4>


                <p>Adding or deleting an element to a list is an example of a event.
                Users can specify if they wish the list to be ordered or unordered. The
                user may wish to sort their list using user-defined conditions. A element
                of a list can be <code>highlighted</code> or <code>disabled</code>. A
                <code>tag</code> can be added to element of a list to display modifications
                or activity.</p>

                <h4> Highlighted List State:</h4>
                <p> Often times, an element on a list may be highlighted to show the user
                that the element is currently selected or active.</p>

                <h3>Variants</h3>

                <blockquote>Lists are a very basic way to group together items that have some overarching similarity. The simplicity is the lists strength as well as its weakness.
                Many other interface elements have become variants to lists because they offer more versatility in their design. 
                Some of these variants are listed<!-- (no pun intended) --> below:

                <li><em>Menus </em> are very close to the look of a list generally displaying a various amount of elements. A distinct difference between a list and 
                menu is the menu items can be clicked on for a event to take place. Also another major difference between menus and lists is a menu item can also 
                be a menu its self.</li>
              

                <h2>Vertical Navigation Bar</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#news">News</a></li>

                </ul>

                <li><em>Tables</em> A table is very similar to a list and even can be considered a list if the table is only displaying a group of elements all under
                the same category. It however is often the case that a table is displaying a grouping of lists to see how the titles of those lists are correlated
                in any way. Tables also create more structure and can't be unordered. </li>

                <h3>Priority Metrics</h3>

                <blockquote>Talk about the five usability metrics in relation to this component. Not all components will have the same
                metric priorities. For example:</blockquote>

                <p>Because the button is such a fundamental part of virtually every user interface available today, it can be said that
                all usability metrics are equally important for this component. Users who are seeing a button in a given platform for
                the first time must not have any issues recognizing it and knowing what to do with it (learnability). The high
                priority of learnability also implies that memorability is a given.</p>

                <p>Users must also never experience undue delays with using a button (efficiency), particularly because using a button
                almost always involves an instantaneous, immediate-result action. Users should almost never trigger a button by
                mistake (errors)—especially buttons whose actions result in significant changes to data or the real world.</p>

                <p>If any metric at all can be considered as a “low priority” for buttons, it would be satisfaction. The button is such
                a utilitarian component that “fun” or “enjoyment” is hardly associated with its use. One exception to this
                prioritization may be for buttons in applications whose primary metric is satisfaction (e.g., games, entertainment).
                As a part of that overall system, making buttons “fun” may then become more important than in other situations.</p>

                <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>

                <blockquote>This section is for describing “what makes for a good <em>your component here</em>?”
                Most likely, this is an amalgam of guidelines documents and platform-independent interaction design
                principles.</blockquote>

                <h4>Feedback</h4>

                <p>Perhaps the most important interaction design principle that a button must follow is <em>feedback</em>. Users must
                never doubt whether:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>they did positively trigger a button (and thus its associated action)</li>
                    <li>they successfully <em>cancelled</em> the triggering of a button, due to changing their minds midway through
                    the action that triggers the button</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Platform-Specific Instances</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>This is where things can get really interesting—platform-specific sections go here. Different versions of
            the same system are considered to be platforms in their own right (e.g., Windows 95 buttons vs. Windows 10
            buttons). Completely customized versions of a component (e.g., a unique-looking/-acting button made specifically
            for a game) are also acceptable here.</p>

            <p>The outline for platform-specific entries resembles the outline already described above, except with a focus
            on how the platform-specific version is <em>different</em>. Thus, you will want some notes on appearance (i.e.,
            more screenshots), behavior, variants, metrics, and characteristics. If some aspect is the same, then say so
            explicitly so that there is no confusion.</p>

            <p>Some platform-specific instances of certain user interface components will merit such a rich discussion that they
            may require a sizable number of supporting assets. In that case, feel free to add subfolders to the main component
            folder, named after the platform under examination.</p>

            <p>This could well be the most distinctive part of the catalog—the sections above this generally appear in user
            interface guidelines, albeit with a platform-specific focus. A key premise of the Paradixm project is to compare
            user interface elements <em>across</em> platforms. Thus, feel free to be creative about presentation here. You
            might want to display a visual gallery, for example, with links leading to individual pages for each covered
            platform-specific user interface component.</p>
